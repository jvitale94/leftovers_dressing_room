# leftovers_dressing_room

This repository contains code that matches up the Leftovers t-shirt with an input image. The relevant files are main.cpp, find_lines.cpp, find_lines_black.cpp, and match_shirts.cpp. All other .cpp files were imported for the sake of familiarizing myself with the OpenCV library. 

##Installation

First, you must have OpenCV installed in order to run this program. Follow [this link](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html#linux-installation) on instructions of how to install OpenCV. You also need to download and inclue opencv_contrib when you make the files. Follow [this link](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) on instructions of how to include opencv_contrib in your library installation. Lastly, you will need to link your XCode environment with your OpenCV library once you have installed it. [This link](https://blogs.wcode.org/2014/11/howto-setup-xcode-6-1-to-work-with-opencv-libraries/) is a fansastic explanation on how to link the libraries properly.
